        <h4>A word from the organiser:</h4>
        <p>Fellow Olympians!<br><br>
            The time has come for the 7th iteration in our storied franchise of
            annual events. This time we return to the birthplace of it all (loosely
            speaking), Landaaaaan Citeeeee!<br><br>
            This year promises to be perhaps the most mentally gruelling and
            unpredictable Olympics yet. The event line up includes a slew of twists
            on old favourites, as well as a few newcomers joining the fray.<br><br>
            As always, expect unimaginable highs, unspeakable lows, and
            everything in between.<br>
            There will be blood.<br>
            There will be sweat.<br>
            There will be tears.<br>
            But above all else… there will be vomit!<br>
            INVICTUS!
        </p>

        <br>
        <h4>Jokers</h4>
        <p>Standard joker rules apply again. 1 joker per Olympian. You must
            clearly announce you wish to use your joker before the relevant event
            begins. Your joker will double your points tally for that round. Your
            joker cannot be used on the Regatta.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Double or Nothing (DoN)</h4>
        <p>This year, when using their jokers, Olympians can also announce
            Double or Nothing (standard joker rules apply). As the name suggests
            this will either double the bonus points or completely nullify them.
            Double or nothing is decided by flip of a 50 pence coin (see appendix).</p>
