        <h1>History of the Olympic games</h1>
        <br>
        <h2>Origins: 2k13 Cowley Road Olympics<sup>TM</sup></h2>
        <p>Contrary to the agreement of ancient Greek historians, the upper floors of 30 Cowley Road, 
            Uxbridge, was in fact the birthplace of the modern Olympics. Inspired by the popular TV show 
            Superstars, revamped in the early 2000’s, in 2013 a list of 10 multidisciplinary events was 
            put together, pitching mostly friends (some foes) against each other in bitter competition. 
            The events (which by current standards would be reviewed as relatively orthodox) were 
            contested over FACE week.
            <br><br>
            That year the Olympic crown was a two-way contest between Mr.C and Shreddo. Mr.C won the 
            opening pint race, but Shreddo took the lead of the contest with golds in the Gym tests and 
            100m dash. Victories in the Strawpedo Elimination and Darts allowed Mr.C to take the battle 
            down to the Olympic closer, the Regatta. After a special brew, a run around the block and 3 
            dry … dry crackers, 3rd place was enough for Shreddo to hold onto the lead despite Mr.C’s 
            Regatta win.
            <br>
            <br>
            From this first edition, the pint race, the 100m and wrong limbed activities were first 
            contested and have largely remained in the contest to this day. However, only the Regatta 
            has been a mainstay throughout and has held its position as the grand finale in all editions. 
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Campus Years: George Shipp Olympics 2k15<sup>TM</sup>, 
            Brian Winstanley Olympics 2k16<sup>TM</sup></h2>
        <p>In 2015 the Olympics moved to Brunel campus and fresh from a year off, the second edition 
            brought with it innovation. The ludicrous opener and initial order establisher High Card 
            event was introduced, along with a one event only double points joker and a Tour de France 
            inspired leaders jersey. Thirsty to enjoy all of these new features, M-Dawg immediately 
            placed his joker on the high card and duly won the opening event giving him the leaders 
            piggy mask and a points lead that he would hold all the way up to the Regatta. 
            <br> <br>
            Jammie Cup and Fives were notable additions to the events list, Millbill won the bike race 
            time trial with equipment rapidly declining by the metre and Coldburger made his one and 
            only Olympic appearance winning two of the four events he entered, the Wrong Arm Throw and 
            the Regatta which for the first time carried double points.
            <br><br>
            Having earned his stripes as Pint Race referee in 2013, K-Money was promoted to entrant in 
            2015 and a 2nd place in the Regatta was enough to overhaul M-Dawg whose 6th place saw him 
            drop to 3rd overall. 
            <br><br>
            2016 was the final Olympics at Brunel with an events list very much in the impression of 
            the previous year. The Royal Rumble and Knob sled offered new entertainment but 10 chip 
            poker and 100m relay would make a forgettable one time appearance.
            <br><br>
            For a second consecutive year the opening high card was won on a Joker, this time by Pah. 
            He would hold on to the leaders Carlton-Banks-sweater-vest-with-nipple-cut-outs jersey all 
            the way up to the penultimate event before revealing a weakness in Fives, marking the 
            beginning of his unravelling.
            <br><br>
            The pack swelled as the events ticked down and the Escape Edition Regatta began with 7 
            Olympians still with the mathematical potential to win, Shreddo marginally out in front. 
            Initially the event was won by Millbill but as the later finishers began escaping Brian 
            Winstanley it became clear that there would be a visit back to the top floor to make a 
            judgement on remaining special brew dregs. Millbill took the staggering decision to vote 
            with the majority calling for himself, Mr.C and Beanie Boo to be disqualified from the 
            event which on calculation cost him what would have been his only ever Olympic title. 
            Shreddo claimed his 2nd Olympic title beating K-Money, having finished in a medal position 
            for each of the final six events.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>Hometown Hosts: 2k17 Brian Fuckstanley Olympics<sup>TM</sup>, 2k18 Mr,C Lympiks<sup>TM</sup>, 
                2k19 Farm Olympics<sup>TM</sup>, 2k21 Big Smoke Olympics<sup>TM</sup></h2>
            <p>Shorham by Sea was the host of the 2017 Olympics and began with an elimination version 
                of high card before the Olympians were divided into teams for a pub golf best of five 
                on the first shit-shirt roulette evening of action. It came down to the fifth and final 
                round and M-Dawg was proven via photofinish to have slammed his empty Guiness back down 
                on the table first to claim a team gold for himself, Tea and Shreddo.
                <br><br>
                The sweaty leaders Morphsuit passed from Tea after the Royal Rumble, to Pah in Jammie cup,
                 to M-Dawg in wrong arm throw and then to Shreddo as he gallantly paced a minimal effort 
                 100m victory across the stoney shoreline. Blood, tears and a footbath followed before 
                 Shreddo’s hopes of a third Olympic crown crumbled and Mr.C went on an unprecedented run 
                 of five consecutive event wins. Golds in the Pint Race, Stop the Clock, Team Beer Pong, 
                 Strawpeado and finally the Regatta saw Mr.C storm from 5th to whopping 27 point lead by 
                 the time he was basking in the Shoreham Sea.
                 <br><br>
                In 2018 Mr.C went from champion to host and took the boys to Watford for Top Golf and Pint 
                Race. Impressively he started where he left off, winning both Friday evening events and 
                wearing the Jersey for the next six events. 
                <br><br>
                Olympic staples were all greeted with a twist, Wrong Arm Frisbee, Endurance Strawpeado, 
                Cemetry Hill 100m. New events balloon popping and plank were enjoyed in the park. However 
                it was the new event, Pub Golf Triathlon, that brought about the complete and total 
                detonation of Mr.C. K-Money shivered his was through Rosé to take gold and initially a 
                Silver for Mr.C looked enough to keep him on track for victory but the boy couldn’t 
                handle his vino. Disqualified from Fives, disqualified from the Hammer and Nail Game, 
                and unable to complete the Regatta. K-Money emerged as the Olympics victor, Mr.C coasted 
                over the line clinging on to 2nd place and an impressive Regatta Gold saw Rose take his 
                first Olympic podium in 3rd place.
                <br><br>
                2019 saw the Olympics visit Millington Farm and the event would birth some of the Olympics 
                most controversial moments in the competition’s history.  New events Russian Roulette 
                Penalties, Sneeze the Fastest, Bike Hill Climb and Gladiator Duel were joined by a team 
                Strawpeado Relay and team 2 Dares 1 Cup.
                <br><br>
                Before the games even began a jumbo pack of stickers and foolishly smug reveal left Mr.C 
                docked points for failing to meet the two animal minimum dress code for the Friday. 
                <br><br>
                Jack took a fleeting lead jokering high card elimination before more than half of the 
                field used the new addition of a joker ‘veto’ in the pint race. Pah wore the leaders cow 
                onesie through Wrong Arm Throw and the Bike Hill Climb. Then Boxchest Mr.C carried his 
                team to Strawpeado victory which would put him into a Leaders Jersey tussle between him 
                and Pah that would go down to the final rounds.
                <br><br>
                K-Money was the only contender to register a score in Sneeze the Fastest and Shreddo won 
                the Gladiatior Duel, surely the Olympic event with the highest level of production. Mr.C 
                won the Chug 100 as title rival Pah was disqualified, the first of ten disqualifications 
                that the field would rack up in the final five rounds.
                <br><br>
                As with 2018, the Pub Golf Triathlon would prove to be the decisive round and this time 
                round chunder was forbidden. Pah took 2nd place but was so drunk he could barely extend 
                his fingers in Fives and K-Money took 3rd place before mixing Special Brew and Crackers 
                in the Regatta, claiming that nothing in the rules says you can’t do it all at once. Mr.C 
                took a steady 5th place in pub golf , learning from his Olympic demons, and then proceeded 
                to silver in Fives and claim a third Regatta gold, sealing the 2019 crown.
                <br><br>
                The Olympics returned to London with the 2021 Big Smoke edition after K-Money failed in 
                being able to successfully host the contest in 2020. The reigning champ, Mr.C made a 
                blistering start on the Friday winning the tweaked events Low Card and a wine only Pint 
                Race before taking gold in the Rock Paper Scissors Cup, closing the opening day with a 
                stunning 23 point lead. From that point the contest for the win was even duller than the 
                Tesco went into every five minutes, but the events list made for many Olympic highlights.
                <br><br>
                The host left his mark on the Olympic records with the first sicking up event, Speed 
                Chunder 3000, Beanie Boo reverse rollie-pollied his way to last in the backwards 100m and 
                then somehow redeemed himself by upsetting the favourites and taking gold in the Wall Sit 
                against the odds. 
                <br><br>
                The Regatta was won for a fourth time by Mr.C as he became the first Olympic champ to 
                defend his title. K-Money and Rose rounded out the top three.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>Host Cities: Maidenbridge 2k22<sup>TM</sup>, 2k23 Leicester Olympics<sup>TM</sup></h2>
            <p>In 2022, Maidenhead sensationally pulled out of being the Olympic host city just hours before 
                the contest was set to take place. The event was rescued with a return to spiritual home of 
                the Olympics in Uxbridge. ‘Host’ Shreddo sculpted the events list despite failing to provide 
                the accommodation.
                <br><br>
                Finnigan’s Face Fuck Fury had it’s first Olympic outing with K-Money reversing his team’s 
                victory by violating the no chunder rule. Pah led the contest at the halfway mark having negotiated 
                a butal run of events: Wrong Arm Beer Pong, Wrong Arm Blindfold Throw, Wrong Foot Jammie Cup, 100m 
                Army Crawl and Handstand Pint Race before a miserable team performance in The Chipper with M-Dawg 
                and Mr.C saw him relinquish the lead to Tea.
                <br><br>
                The now modern classic Olympic event of Stack Cup Elimination was won by Tea against a stone cold 
                sober MillBill, and after he and Pah both scored relatively evenly in the Donut Challenge, Tea held 
                an 11 point lead heading into the final round.
                <br><br>
                The Ultimate Regatta, double distance, downing and dry crackering, proved to be the most brutal 
                event in Olympic history and with most playing only for pride by that point, Mr.C lead home only 
                four finishers for his fifth Regatta win. Tea, resplendent in yellow leotard, became the fourth 
                name on the Olympic winners list.
                <br><br>
                The 2023 Leicester Olympics, seemingly relocated from the beach at some point, was ‘organised’ by 
                Beanie Boo. With an events list that seemingly followed it’s own imagination throughout the event, 
                nine Olympians were on the start list ready to face each other off in a heat system. 
                <br><br>
                Fishbowl Beach Fury kicked off the event before the Olympics confused itself through the Beach 
                Russian Roulette and Beach Noughts & Crosses, finally hitting safe territory as MillBill took gold 
                in the return of the Stack Cup Elimination and with it the leaders cycling jersey, swim cap & goggles. 
                K-Money seized the lead across the Saturday daytime with strong performance as the Plank and Jammie 
                Cup returned to the Olympics either side of the new event, Dead Hang. 
                <br><br>
                The Olympics then staged its first long format running race with 3km around the blissful housing 
                estate of Astill. M-Dawg ran home ahead of K-Money and Mr.C before the Olympics retire to the pub 
                to slug it out over Olympics classics Fives and High Card as well as Olympics shitshow Beach Shithead. 
                K-Money had a near mathematically unclose-able lead heading into the Regatta and duly became the 
                second three-time champ in Olympic history.
